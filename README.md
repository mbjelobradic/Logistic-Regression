# Logistic-regression
examples of logistic regression

Performs logistic regression on a dataset with two features and binary classification labels. It defines the logistic cost function, computes the gradient, and uses gradient descent to optimize model parameters (weights and bias) for classification. The code then plots the data points and the resulting decision boundary, showcasing the model's ability to separate the two classes.
